# HR-Analysis

I have developed an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, SQL, and data visualization techniques to provide actionable insights into workforce trends, employee satisfaction, and retention. This project showcases my ability to analyze complex HR data, build interactive dashboards, and derive meaningful business insights.

This project is to help monitor key HR metrics such as attrition rate, employee engagement, performance trends, and salary distribution. By leveraging Power BI, I have applied data transformations, and created dynamic visual reports that enable better decision-making.

## Tech Stack

**Application:** Power BI

Microsoft Excel

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

**Techniques:** Data Visualization & Data Modeling techniques




## Optimizations

Cleaned and structured data model for efficiency

Used reusable DAX measures for better performance

Applied conditional formatting to highlight key trends

Enabled dynamic filtering through slicers

Maintained consistent color schemes and visual hierarchy


## Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Live previews
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform
- Clean and Structured Data Model
- Attrition analysis across departments and roles
- Tenure & experience insights
- Time-Based Analysis
- Interactive slicers for dynamic exploration
- Reusable Measures and Fields
- Clean and user-friendly dashboard layout



## Roadmap

Here’s the structured workflow I followed to complete this Power BI project:

**1. Data Import:** – Loaded Excel dataset into Power BI.

**2. Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, fixed types, renamed columns using Power Query.

**3. Data Modeling** – Defined relationships and created necessary DAX measures.

**4. Visualizations** – Designed charts and KPIs to highlight core insights.

**5. Interactivity** – Added slicers for age, department, education, and more.

**6. Polishing** – Final visual tweaks and dashboard optimization.

Published to Power BI Service for sharing with stakeholders.


## Usage

This dashboard helps HR teams understand employee trends and make better decisions.

**You can use it to:**

View employee distribution by department, role, gender, and education

Track attrition rates and identify areas of concern

Analyze experience and income patterns

Filter data using slicers to explore specific groups
