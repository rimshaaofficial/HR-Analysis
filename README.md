# HR-Analysis

I have developed an HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI, SQL, and data visualization techniques to provide actionable insights into workforce trends, employee satisfaction, and retention. This project showcases my ability to analyze complex HR data, build interactive dashboards, and derive meaningful business insights.

This project is to help monitor key HR metrics such as attrition rate, employee engagement, performance trends, and salary distribution. By leveraging Power BI, I have applied data transformations, and created dynamic visual reports that enable better decision-making.

This project reflects my expertise in data storytelling, business intelligence, and analytical thinking, demonstrating my ability to translate raw data into impactful insights that drive business improvements. I am passionate about turning data into strategic solutions, and this dashboard is an example of how I apply my technical and analytical skills to solve real-world challenges.
